*
* To use LDAP server, you have to install some backend. Most users would need MDB
* backend which you can install with: apk add openldap-back-mdb.
*
* If you use overlays, you have to install them separately too:
* apk add openldap-overlay-<name>, or openldap-overlay-all to install them all.
*
* /etc/openldap/slapd.conf soon will not be used by this package anymore, so you may
* prepare for that and transition to the use of /etc/openldap/slapd.d instead.
